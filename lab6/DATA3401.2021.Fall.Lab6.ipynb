    "## Monte Hall Problem\n",
    "In the 1960s there was a game show called Let's Make a Deal, whose host was Monte Hall. One famous game went as follows.\n",
    "1. The host shows the contestant 3 doors, and tells them that behind 1 door is a **brand new car**, while behind the other 2 doors there are goats\n",
    "1. The contestant chooses a door\n",
    "1. Now the host opens one of the remaining 2 doors and shows the contestant that this door held a goat\n",
    "1. The host asks the contestant if they would like to **switch** their choice to the remaining door, or to **stay** with their original guess\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the question: should the contestant **switch** or **stay**?  "
