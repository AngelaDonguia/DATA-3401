    "You may not discuss the problems with **anyone else**, including persons on an online internet forum. Consulting an outside source like this will be considered an academic integrity violation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use all class resources including previous labs and lectures, and anything posted on the course GitHub repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may not use any function that trivializes a problem. For example, if I ask you to write a `max` function that computes the maximum entry in a list, you are not allowed to use the pre-defined Python function `max`; you must write your own.\n",
