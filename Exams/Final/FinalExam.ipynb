    "\n",
    "You may not use any function that trivializes a problem. For example, if I ask you to write a `max` function that computes the maximum entry in a list, you are not allowed to use the pre-defined Python function `max`; you must write your own.\n",

    "1. Create a `card` class that has two attributes: `value` and `suit`. A card should be initialized by passing it both the value and suit.\n",

    "    1. Each card in the deck should be of type card (the class you made in Step 1)\n",
    "    1. Your deck should be a list of 52 cards (see midterm for card description if needed)\n",
    "    1. Your deck should be ordered, and should have the option of `shuffled` (True or False) upon initialization. If `shuffled` is False, the deck should be in order (Ace-2 of Spades, Ace-2 of Clubs, Ace-2 of Diamonds, Ace-2 of Hearts), otherwise if `shuffled` is True, the deck should be randomly ordered\n",
    "    1. Create a method `deal_cards(num_cards)` that chooses the **first** `num_cards` cards from the deck and returns a list of these cards. This method should also remove the cards from the deck.\n",
    "    1. Create a `shuffle` method to shuffle the deck.\n",
    "1. Create a subclass of `deck` called `hand`\n",
    "    1. A `hand` will be a list of cards\n",
    "    1. A `hand` should be initialized with an option of `num_cards` for the number of cards in the hand, and should be initialized via the `deal_cards` method of your `deck` class\n",

    "    1. Create a method to check if a hand is a straight (consecutive cards; for simplicity, assume Ace is high (i.e., Ace, King, ..., 2 is the order of the numbers))\n",
    "1. Using your classes, create an unshuffled deck, and deal 5 hands of 5 cards each. \n",
    "    1. Check if each hand is a flush, and report the results along with the suits of the flush(es). \n",
    "    1. Check if each hand is a straight and report the results\n",
    "1. Create a shuffled deck and deal 9 hands of 5 cards. Check for straights and flushes and report the results."
