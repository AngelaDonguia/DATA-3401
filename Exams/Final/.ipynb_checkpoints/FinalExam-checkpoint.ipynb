    "This final exam is simliar to the midterm exam. Please work the exercises below **on your own**.  When you have completed the exam, you should push your completed jupyter notebook to your GitHub repo for this class in the **Exams->Final** folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not discuss the problems with **anyone else**, including persons on an online internet forum. Consulting an outside source like this will be considered an academic integrity violation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use all class resources including previous labs and lectures, and anything posted on the course GitHub repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may not use any function that trivializes a problem. For example, if I ask you to write a `max` function that computes the maximum entry in a list, you are not allowed to use the pre-defined Python function `max`; you must write your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each problem below (including the Bonus) will be worth approximately 20 points. Achieving over 100 on this exam is possible if the Bonus is completed."

As before, write a function `random_walk(num_steps,init_position)` that takes an integer for `num_steps` corresponding to how many steps the random walker will take, and a numpy array for `init_position` with x and y coordinates of the starting point. The function should return the full sequence of positions of the walker as they take `num_steps` steps\n",
