So is it not with me as with that Muse
Stirr'd by a pated beauty to his verse,
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
 every fair with his fair doth rehearse
Makg a couplement of proud compare,
With sun  moon, with earth  sea's rich gems,
With April's first-born flowers,  all thgs rare
That heaven's air  this huge rondure hems.
O' let me, true  love, but truly write,
 n believe me, my love is as fair
As any mor's child, though not so bright
As those gold cles fix'd  heaven's air:
Let m say more than like of hearsay well;
I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
