Write a function that rolls a dice `n` times for a given integer `n` and computes a *running percentage* of times each number is rolled (# of times 1 has been rolled)/(# of rolls so far) and so on. That is, at the `i`-th roll, you should compute (# of 1s)/i, (# of 2s)/i, ... and store these values.\n",

    "## Background: Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) establishes that, when independent random variables are added together, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution (informally a “bell curve”) even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed. To understand this theorem, suppose you generate 100 uniform random numbers and sum them to get a single number. Then you repeat this procedure 1000 times to get 1000 of these sums of 100 uniform random numbers. The CLT theorem implies that if you plot a histogram of the values of these 1000 sums, then the resulting distribution looks very much like the Gaussian bell-shaped function. The larger the number of these sums (for example, 100000 instead of 1000 sums), the more the resulting distribution will look like a Gaussian. Here we want to see this theorem in action.\n",

    "## Exercise 4\n",
    "Consider that a person is standing on the real line at a given point $x_0$. The person then goes on a \"random walk\", meaning that they first take a step of size 1 in a random direction (so after this step they are either standing at $x_0+1$ or $x_0-1$), then they take another step of size 1 in a random direction (after the second step they are standing at one of $x_0-2, x_0,$ or  $x_0+2$), and they continue this process for $n$ steps. At each stage, the person flips a fair coin to decide which direction to go in.\n",
    "1. Write a function `RandomWalk(num_steps,start_position)`, that takes the number of steps `num_steps` for a random walk and the `start_position` of the random walk on the real line (so a float), and returns the location of the final step of the random walker.\n",
    "2. Write another function `SimulateRandomWalk(num_sims,num_steps,start_position)` that simulates num_sims number of random walks, each of which contains `num_steps` steps and starts at `start_position`. Then, this function calls `RandomWalk()` repeatedly for `num_sims` times and finally returns a vector of size `num_sim` containing the final locations of all of the `num_sims` simulated random-walks.\n",
    "3. Now write a script that plots the output of `SimulateRandomWalk(num_sims = 10000, num_steps = 10, start_position = 0)` in a histogram\n",
